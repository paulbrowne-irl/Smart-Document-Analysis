# NOW (MAX OF 4)

+ directory walker - add first pass at DB , driven by web

## PROJECT AIM
Currently pushing to get text loaded to neo4j graph, then analyse
Search *all* text snippets and suggest companies

## tidy

+ logging instead of printing
+ better commetns (pydoc - google how it is done)

## Next

+ NEXT - resinsatll neo4j, try http in connection url (for graphDBObject_test.py)

+ try <https://neomodel.readthedocs.io/en/latest/> to map python
+ read info using js (movie app)
  + poss <https://github.com/neo4j+examples/movies+graphql+javascript>
    + popoto samples
    + neovist (expand existing)
+ read info using python (move app)
+ Play with visualisations against existing DB (tools, HTML/JS other)
+ Samples from: <https://neo4j.com/developer/tools+graph+visualization/>
+ Load data (python? Java plan B)
+ refine data using tools below (mostly python)
+ simple python documentation on classes

## Spec + Adminstration

+ Process must be  
  + semi automated to create from source
  + not give away any sensitive data
+ Loading
  + prep process to text
  + try and keep meta data
  + Anonymize (remove sensistive)
+ split between
  + data that can be blown away and recrated
    + data (such as stop words) that needs to be kept
+ enrich data

## Spec + View

    +  Explore Data
    + Simple defaults
    + explanation on these defaults
    + explain where these numbers are coming from
    + more complicated query
    + export entity numbers to excel

## Data structure

+ Company
  + document
        + paragraph
            + scores on para?
    + other meta
      + Company ID
+ Text
  + key words linked

## Skills

+ Debugging Python
+ Neo4j Python
+ modules

## Housekeeping

+ Move all scripts to under web app
+ Make all scripts web+y
+ Can call all scripts from commandl ine

+ Update docs + put at the top of each script
+ smart_analyse_gensim_topics.py  make sure script and todo is documented, promote back from incubators
+ Cosine similarity + make sure script and todo is documented
+ Review Smart.xlsx
  + Document how to update
  + see if format useful for what trying to report now
+ Upgrade readme.md to an end user guide (what is this data showing, once reports generated)
+ Build on index.py to give web interface to reports
+ Build on /tests + <http://flask.pocoo.org/docs/0.12/testing/>

## Play and decide next step

+ Investigate Apache Superset (for visualisations)
+ Investigate Scattertext for visualisation
+ Visualize topics (google how to) <https://www.machinelearningplus.com/nlp/topic+modeling+gensim+python/>
+ Inspect using Python Feature tools (google how to use for NLP)
+ Gensim (and tutorial). Good for similarity queries based on common topics <https://radimrehurek.com/gensim/tut1.html> (and 2) use LSI for topics
+ Sentiment Analysis: <https://medium.com/@pmin91/aspect+based+opinion+mining+nlp+with+python+a53eb4752800>

## Target Analysis Aims

+ Aim to get the Corpus / Vectorisation "good enough" for a pass over the CES
+ Similarity of documents
+ topics per document
+ try grouping (extract topics)
+ try grouping (given topics)
+ try closeness
+ New document, find similar
+ Extract possible topics
+ Extract Sales and Marketing Element
+ Extract Market
+ Extract possible ids
+ Extract possible company name
+ Extract possible issues
+ Extract end sectors
+ Extract per sector
+ sentiment analysis
+ build tagging for later machine learning
+ Key issues

## Data Sources

+ Saved Reports
+ Company reports ## More data
Python:scrape and Analyze company directory: <https://irishadvantage.com/company+directory/>
+ Search online for Business Corpus

## Medium Term

+ update words in word_knowledge.xlsx
+ rerun smart_corpus.py, check doc
+ Python Tests
 take output newwords and add
+ filter 2 letter words in file (then tell code to ignore)
+ Better stemming
+ list of countries
+ better stopwords

+ changes to output
  + check that we are operating on keywords
  + double keyword output
    + filter obvious words? (only show instersting, remove if then etc)
    + implement mapping (or make note to do so later)
    + implement highlight (filter into pivor table)
    + make project GDPR compliant ( delete document folder, link to repository instead)
+ click for better command line handling:     <http://click.pocoo.org/5/>

## Learning actions / Bucket

+ Work through jupyter notebook from Colubmai
+ read articles Pocket
+ Positive / negative sentiment analysis
+ Naive Bayes classifcation of documents?
+ To look at: TextBlob?
+ To look at: NLTK book samples

Q: What way to gather my feedback (e.g. keywords, constrain to pillars / 6 elements, Markets)

## Reporting + using

+ <https://de.dariah.eu/tatom/topic_model_visualization.html#topic+model+visualization> or similar
  + Date
  + Company year
  + by Salles and marketing severity
  + Sales and Marketing element
  + by target market
